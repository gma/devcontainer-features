devcontainer-features
=====================

This repository contains [features] for the tools that I find useful when working with [devcontainers].

The implementation of my devcontainer features is based heavily on the examples provided in the [devcontainers/feature-starter] template repository.

[features]: https://containers.dev/features
[devcontainers]: https://containers.dev
[devcontainers/feature-starter]: https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-starter

Running the tests
-----------------

The `devcontainer` command provides support for testing devcontainer features. This repository has tests, which are run automatically in a GitHub action.

To run them locally, install the `devcontainer` command:

```sh
npm install -g @devcontainer/cli
```

Then run the tests:

```sh
devcontainer features test --skip-autogenerated .
```
